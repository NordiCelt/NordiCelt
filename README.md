## Biography  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I joined the U.S. Navy in December of 2007 initially to be a Sonar Technician (Surface). After over a year of training in Electronic troubleshooting, the physics of sound, sonar operations, and hull mounted sonar maintenance and repair, I went to the fleet onboard the USS Normandy (CG-60) in March of 2009. From there I was an M240 Gunner, Sonar Supervisor, Hazardous Material Supervisor, among many other qualifications. I participated in earthquake relief efforts in Haiti in 2010, followed by a middle east deployment that same year, and then a 2012 Baltic Operation in which we duelled with French, British, and Russian submarines in the Baltic Sea.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a sea tour, which kept me from my family much of the time, I reenlisted as a Yeoman, an Administrative professional, focusing on the use of Microsoft Office products and Naval websites as my main tools. I moved on to a Naval Reserve Center in Riverside, California in 2013 after volunteering to go back to school (Legal Clerk School, and Yeoman "A" School).  I made my way into Information Systems as early as 2014 as the computer, networking, cybersecurity and software subject matter expert for each of my Commands between 2014-2022. I just always found myself in a position in which an IT was needed, and I was the only one who had the knowledge to fulfill that role.    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting in 2014 I began experimenting with various Linux operating systems, and learned the basics of how the internet worked. I became the Information Systems Security Officer for about 12 Active Duty and 450 Reservist Naval Service Members at my Command in Riverside, California.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 2015 I taught myself Front End technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). I began building websites for myself and for friends, in addition to volunteering for 2 non-profits, using my skills to enhance their sites. For one of these (WikiTree, a genealogical site) I became one of their "supervisors" coordinating efforts to build on existing projects, plus becoming co-author of a project recognizing veterans around the world who had been awarded their nations highest military honor. I built the markdown and HTML for the sites display, while using inline CSS (a requirment for that particular site) to place and adjust pictures and decoration.    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2016 I transferred to a fighter squadron in Fallon, Nevada, and was quickly recognized as an IT professional and subsequently put in charge of their IT program for my first year on board. I found many missing assets (end points) and then single-handedly replaced all of their single use peripherals (printers/scanners/fax machines) with multi-function devices, to meet a new Naval policy that was being implemented. The difficulties of pushing through a year of red tape and then ensuring all devices ran smoothly can not be underestimated in the Department of Defense. By 2017, a "rated" IT came on board and I was forced to turn over to him, while taking over duties as acting Leading Chief Petty Officer of the Administrative (correspondence, awards, directives, evaluations), Manpower (like human resources, ensuring pay, plus orders are carried out), Medical (including the medical and dental needs of the Command), and Career Counselor (managing personnel reenlistments, retirements, and records of that type) Departments. This took me away from the IT Department, but gave me time to develop my leadership skills and obtain my Associates Degree.    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2020, I transferred to Fargo, North Dakota, and within 3 months, took over as the Command IT, and Classified Material Custodian (in addition to many other roles). Here I dabbled with the A+, and Security+ certifications, in addition to the CCNA. Cybersecurity and Networking took my off-work interests, and I applied it to the many issues the Command had with their Network. I led efforts to get a T2 Network which barely worked, and multiple outdated computer systems that were all but useless, to be replaced with a 1Gig fiber network and new laptops for almost all personnel. Due to my knowledge and efforts, the Navy Region Northwest selected me to lead the test in a new multimillion-dollar contract with AT&T to replace our outdated Wi-Fi system. In addition, I trained the 10 Active Duty and 65 Reservist Sailors in topics such as password creation and management, anti-virus software, USB bus management, and discovered 2 functioning Wi-Fi Access Points the Command had no prior knowledge of. In addition, I developed a way to implement electronic signitures utilizing PIV certificates on the military Common Access Cards that the Department of Defense but, to my knowledge, no one had figured out how to do. By Spring of 2021, all correspondence, directives, and many other items previously utilizing multitudes of paper being printed and filed away, we were 98% digital, even with filing and storage.  I also found a way to securely share files on our Command Sharepoint page that I had built.    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2021 I studied C# and the .NET ecosystem, in addition to many topics in Cyber Security. Now my focus is in Windows Server (2016 and 2019), Networking (primarily, but not exclusively, CISCO), and cloud-based technologies like Azure and AWS.
