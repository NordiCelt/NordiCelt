- 👋 Hi, I’m @NordiCelt
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber Security (leaning heavily into red teaming), networks, programming, and web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Penetration Testing, C# and the .NET environment, Bash scripting, and many other things.  I'm addicted to learning and bettering myself and my family.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything; I'm new to programming, but I fully intend on colaborating very soon.
