# Learning Blog
## 29 May 2021 
> I just finished the live training from CompTIA on Security+. I have been exploring on my own with Kali Linux and the tools therein. I have read a lot of the nmap and wireshark documentation, and have taken on more projects since.  The Sec+ certification is pretty broad and easy as far as the concepts, but I think it will be a challenge due to all of the acronyms that we have to memorize. I'm usually much better at hands on activities than I am in memorizing anything. My memory has always been my biggest foe to learning. Anyway, I'm not worried.  I am still going through all the practice tests and labs that came with the "bundle" from CompTIA, and I see myself going for the certification within a month from now. <br>
> I have enrolled in TryHackMe.com to get into the hands-on activities of Cyber Security. What a great site! I started from the very beginning, so it is the "Complete Beginner Path", and I am 21% done with that. I have completed Linux Fendamentals, and begun the Networking Fundamentals. I also finished the VIM and Find (Linux find command) rooms, which are not part of the actual path.
