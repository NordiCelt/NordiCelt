## Biography  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though my Naval career was to be a Sonar Technician and then an Administrative professional, focusing on the use of Microsoft Office products and Naval websites as my main tools, I made my way into Information Systems as early as 5 years into my career. I was the computer, networking, cybersecurity and software subject matter expert for each of my Commands.    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting in 2014 I began experimenting with various Linux operating systems, and learned the basics of how the internet worked. I became the Information Systems Security Officer for about 12 Active Duty and 450 Reservist Naval Service Members at my Command in Riverside, California.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 2015 I taught myself Front End technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). I began building websites for myself and for friends, in addition to volunteering for 2 non-profits, using my skills to enhance their sites. For one of these (WikiTree, a genealogical site) I became one of their "supervisors" coordinating efforts to build on existing projects, plus becoming co-author of a project recognizing veterans around the world who had been awarded their nations highest military honor. I built the markdown and HTML for the sites display, while using inline CSS (a requirment for that particular site) to place and adjust pictures and decoration.    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2016 I transferred to a fighter squadron in Fallon, Nevada, and was quickly recognized as an IT professional and subsequently put in charge of their IT program for my first year on board. I found many missing assets (end points) and then single-handedly replaced all of their single use peripherals (printers/scanners/fax machines) with multi-function devices, to meet a new Naval policy. The difficulties of pushing through a year of red tape and then ensuring all devices ran smoothly can not be underestimated in the Department of the Defense. By 2017, a "rated" IT came on board and I was forced to turn over to him, while taking over duties as acting Leading Chief Petty Officer of the Administrative (correspondence, awards, directives, evaluations), Manpower (like human resources, ensuring pay, plus orders are carried out), Medical (including the medical and dental needs of the Command), and Career Counselor (managing personnel reenlistments, retirements, and records of that type) Departments. This took me away from the IT Department, but gave me time to develop my leadership skills and obtain my Associates Degree.    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2020, I transferred to Fargo, North Dakota, and within 3 months, took over as the Command IT, and Classified Material Custodian (in addition to many other roles). Here I dabbled with the A+, and Security+ certifications, in addition to the CCNA. Cybersecurity and Networking took my off-work interests, and I applied it to the many issues the Command had with their Network. I led efforts to get a T2 Network which barely worked, and multiple outdated computer systems that were all but useless, to be replaced with a 1Gig fiber network and new laptops more almost all personnel. Due to my knowledge and efforts, the Navy Region Northwest selected me to lead the test in a new multimillion-dollar contract with AT&T to replace our outdated Wi-Fi system. In addition, I trained the 10 Active Duty and 65 Reservist Sailors in topics such as password creation and management, anti-virus software, USB bus management, and discovered 2 Wi-Fi Access Points the Command had no prior knowledge of.    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2021 I began my studies of C# and the .NET ecosystem.
